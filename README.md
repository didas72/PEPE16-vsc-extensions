# PEPE-16 Visual Studio Code Extensions

This repository contains all of my VSCode extensions written for the PEPE-16 processor.
There is a README inside each directory with more information about each extension.
This was NOT the original repository. Each extension had it's own. Due to this fact, code here is only tracked since 24Nov23, with the following versions of each extension:

- PEPE-16 Syntax Highlighting (ASM) - v1.0.5
- PEPE-16 Formatter (ASM) - v1.1.0
- PEPE-16 Intellisense (ASM) - v1.0.0

The license in the base directory of this repository applies to all extensions.
